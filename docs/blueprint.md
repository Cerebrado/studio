## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of intelligence, focus, and quick-thinking, all appropriate for a word game.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F6FD), a lighter tint of the primary that is easy on the eyes for extended play.
- Accent color: Green (#87D37C) for correct answers and success indicators; this is approximately 30 degrees from blue, in the counter-clockwise direction.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short information, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and modern appearance.
- Use clean, simple icons for feedback (correct/incorrect), timer, and social sharing. Icons should be easily recognizable and consistent with the game's modern aesthetic.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear visual hierarchy. Important elements like the timer and score should be prominently displayed.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and feedback, such as a smooth countdown timer or a brief pulse effect when a word is correctly entered.
